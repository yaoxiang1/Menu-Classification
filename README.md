Menu-Classification
===================

Researched and developed an expert system to classify menu types using a knowledge-base system and Naive Bayesian 
classification with 95% accuracy

The idea for this project comes from the Pandora music recommendation, since each music is classified into different 
general categories first and then into specific music types within that certain category.

1. First classify menu into different restaurant categories using Naive Bayesina classification
2. Then, we use expert system & fixed rule to classify the a certain menu into specific types by enable the clients to set 
   sepcific keywords
